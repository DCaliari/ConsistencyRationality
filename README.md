The code contains replication files for the figures and tables in the paper, as well as further code for some figures in the Online Appendix.
The code is organized such that each Figure/Table can be replicated separately to ease the process.
The Folder "Code figures" contains the MATLAB code for each figure indexed in the name of the file. The simply work by pressing "Start" once the Replication Package folder is on path.
The Folder "code submission 2025" contains extra code that has been used in the Online Appendix.
The Folder "Functions" contains instrumental code such as loading data and the structural estimation (loglikelihood functions, EM algorithm, etc...).
Data are collected in the excel files "DATI.xlsx" and "Dataset Creation - sep.xlsx".
